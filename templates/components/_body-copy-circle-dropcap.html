But after a while, you could chat to your friend or belt out Taylor Swift’s Shake It Off at the same time and still nail it. Why? Because it became a habit. In fact, 40% of the actions we perform in a day are automatic, so we’re actually on autopilot a lot of the time. That 11am KitKat with your tea? Habit. The on-the-way-to-work coffee? Yep, you guessed it... 

	Scientists say that our brains try to make as many of our behaviours as automatic as possible, so that we have more mental energy to devote to other things (such as staying alive). That’s why bad habits can be so hard to kick. But the good news is, by adopting a few sneaky tactics and working with your brain, you can banish the bad ones for good and pick up healthier habits instead. Just try following these simple rules to help kick them to the curb.
