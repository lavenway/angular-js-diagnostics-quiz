    	<p><strong>Reward </strong>Adopting healthy habits shouldn’t be a snore-fest, so make it fun by rewarding yourself. Let’s say you want to start running three times a week – your reward might be going for a healthy brunch with a friend after a weekend run. Or squirrel away the cash you’ve saved from swerving the coffee shop and buy yourself a new outfit.</p>
